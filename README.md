# This is my first gitHub repository!

## Hello Jerks.

I can use markdown to *italicize* and **bold** my text.

Also, I can [link](google.com/images) things that i find on the internet.

When I get home I am going to:

1. Eat
1. Sleep

Thank Dog tomorrow is Friyay!

```{python}
for i in range(10)
print i```
